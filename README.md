# Hash Algorithm

  

## How to run

Open a terminal or command prompt (Windows)
Clone the repository:  
``` git clone git@github.com:glenntippett/md5-hash.git```  
Move into the directory:  
```cd md5-hash```  
run  
```npm install```  
to install the dependencies

Once the packages have finished installing initiate the app in a terminal with
```node app.js```  

### Expected Behaviour:  

You will be prompted to enter an amount, the app will then provide two values: an MD5 Hash and an MD5 Hash with Salt
